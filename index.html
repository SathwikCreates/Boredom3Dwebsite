        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I started coding because I was curious. I kept coding because it turned out to be a way to say things, solve problems, and sometimes even make people laugh (yeah, I made a dad joke extension — no regrets).
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, I’m a Computer Science student at Pragati Engineering College. But outside of classes, I’m usually experimenting — making tools for students like the EPASS app, building things like attendance trackers, and messing around with creative projects that help people ask someone out (because hey, why not make that easier too?).
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a space where I share what I’m building, what I’m learning, and where I’ve messed up along the way. It's less of a "portfolio" and more of a work-in-progress journal — and I’m cool with that.

          Built 9+ personal and college-level projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend tools like Node.js and SQL.

          Created a Dad Jokes browser extension using AI tools to deliver jokes on-click or on-timer — live on the Chrome Web Store or GitHub.

         Developed “EPASS”, a full-stack web application to digitize college outpass requests — eliminating paperwork and streamlining professor approvals.

          Designed a mini library management system with book tracking and intelligent book recommendations based on borrowing history.

          Built multiple “love-themed” web projects, including Flowers-for-Valentines, Express Love, and Ask on a Date, creatively using HTML/CSS/JS to help people express feelings through code.
